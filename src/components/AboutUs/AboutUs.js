            <h3>Educational background questions.</h3>
            <p>
              One of the most common job interview topics is your educational
              background. You may wonder why hiring managers ask about something
              that is probably featured prominently on your resume.
            </p>
            <h3>Your educational background.</h3>
            <p>
              Your educational background is the set of all the formal and
              informal education that you have achieved, plus any new learning
              opportunities you are pursuing or plan to pursue soon.
            </p>
            <h3>Start with the required minimum.</h3>
            <p>
              For example, if the listing states that a bachelorâ€™s degree is
              required, confirm that you have one and share your major.
